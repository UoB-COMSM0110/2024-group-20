# Game ideas
-> Snake (twists: two snakes, challenges: detect collisions, snake movement, trails logic)

-> flappy bat (twist: you don't see the whole map just the area around you bat and ultrasounds, challenges: radar, map generation, moving pipes or two players)

-> space invaders (twist: but we're the aliens invading, challenge: enemy movement, making barriers that lose life, shooting system)

-> doodle jump (twist: multi player challenge: multi-player game, different objects to collect which have functions, map generation)

# Final Game
 -> Nervous Game -> movement of pig, budget in the level, falling birds (different birds have different effects), game interface (start, exit, new levels), structure allocation, rotating structures, real life physics (can kill the pig), difficulty(-different birds, structure of terrain also changes sometimes can build sometimes can't), possibly more than one pig
